Personal project for learning [flask].
Most of the structure is heavily based on [The Flask Mega-Tutorial]

## Quickstart

Create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`
```bash
# Create and activate venv
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Upgrade database and run server
```bash
flask db upgrade
flask run
```

All that's left now is to import some transactions, but everything's already set up!
